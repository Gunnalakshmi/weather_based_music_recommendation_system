# weather_based_music_recommendation_system

🎵 Weather-Based Music Genre Recommender A deep learning-powered web app that detects the weather condition from an uploaded image and recommends a suitable music genre based on the predicted weather! 🌦 Overview This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on VGG16 to classify weather conditions from images. It is integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit web interface, which then recommends music genres tailored to the detected weather.
